Task 1: Simple Calculator
Objective: Write a script that acts as a simple calculator. The script should take two numbers and an operator as input and perform the corresponding operation.

Instructions:

Declare three variables: num1, num2, and operator.
Use a switch statement to perform the operation based on the operator.
+: Add num1 and num2
-: Subtract num2 from num1
*: Multiply num1 and num2
/: Divide num1 by num2
%: Find the remainder when num1 is divided by num2


 
Task 2: Print the First 10 Multiples of 5
Objective: Write a script that uses a for loop to print the first 10 multiples of 5.

Instructions:

Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
Print the product of the loop variable and 5.


Task 3: Calculate Factorial of a Number

Objective: Write a script that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.

Instructions:

Declare a variable for the number.
Use a for loop to calculate its factorial.
Print the factorial.


Task 4: FizzBuzz

Objective: Write a script that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Instructions:

Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 100.
Use conditional statements to check if the current number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both.
Print the appropriate message based on the condition.
